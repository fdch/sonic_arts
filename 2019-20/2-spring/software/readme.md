# Software

In here there are some links for software to be used during the class

## Pure Data

Get Pure Data for your platform of preference: [http://msp.ucsd.edu](http://msp.ucsd.edu)

## fd_lib

Once you have Pure Data (or simply `pd`), open it and go to `Help>Find Externals`. Type `fd_lib` and get this library that we will be using [1].

## thornblower

Finally, get the patch that we will be using to improvise, called [thornblower](https://fdch.github.io/thornblower). The repo is here: [https://github.com/fdch/thornblower](https://github.com/fdch/thornblower). NOTE: if you are not familiar with github, just find the green 'Clone or download' button and select 'Download Zip'.

[1] It is also available at [https://github.com/fdch/fd_lib](https://github.com/fdch/fd_lib) but you'd need to compile some part of it for it to work :)
