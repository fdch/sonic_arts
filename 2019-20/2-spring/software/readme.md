# Software

In here there are some links for software to be used during the class

## Pure Data

Get pure data here for your platform of preference: [Pure Data](https://msp.ucsd.edu)

Once you have Pure Data (`pd`), open it and go to `Help>Find Externals`. Type `fd_lib` and get this library that we will be using. It is also available at [https://github.com/fdch/fd_lib](https://github.com/fdch/fd_lib) but you'd need to compile some part of it for it to work :)

Finally, get [https://github.com/fdch/thornblower](https://github.com/fdch/thornblower).
