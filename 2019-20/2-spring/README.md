### Academic misconduct:

It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term 'academic misconduct' includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student Conduct http://studentlife.osu.edu/csc/.

### Mental Health Concerns:

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS) by visiting ccs.osu.edu or calling 614-292-5766. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center and 10th Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call counselor when CCS is closed at 614-292-5766 and 24 hour emergency help is also available through the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273- TALK or at suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

### Undergraduate Student Concert Attendance Expectation:

All fulltime undergraduate music majors must demonstrate a persistent pattern of professional and musical growth through the regular attendance and support for faculty and student recitals, concerts, and academic presentations in the School of Music and Greater Columbus community. An additional demonstration of persistent growth through concert attendance may include, but is not limited to, the student’s informed reflections in the studio or classroom on various School of Music performances and presentations.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let Dr. Ainger know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion.

Hearing Wellness: Protection and preservation of your hearing is an important responsibility as a mature musician. All students are encouraged to schedule annual hearing examinations to monitor subtle changes in hearing over time. Additionally, the acquisition and regular use of custom-fitted “musician’s ear plugs” will help ensure preservation of hearing. Audiology examinations and custom-fitted hearing protection can be attained through the Ohio State Department of Speech and Hearing Science on west campus.
